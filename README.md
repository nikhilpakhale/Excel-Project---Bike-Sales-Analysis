A simple sales analysis project on excel using pivot tables and charts.

While executing this project, I learned and used Data Cleaning, Data Processing, Data Analysis and Data Visualization.

**Objective:** To analyse the data provided by the bike selling company in order to extract insights and learn about their customers and increase their sales and profits.

The dashboard shows the customer and sales information in terms of income, commute distance, age group, education, etc. and the visuals can be filtered based on the marital status and region of the customer using the slicers.

Thanks to *Alex Freberg* for the invaluable guidance.
